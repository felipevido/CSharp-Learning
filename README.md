## OBJECT-ORIENTED PROGRAMMING WITH C#

**I'm retaking this course. It's been a long time since I completed it, than I haven't studied C# often.** 

Just try'n remember all the concepts and this language tecniques, all over from the basic.
So, I decided upload the exercises here and track my progress.

> **PS: I love Front-End, even so I focusing on Back-End this year.**
